The Echo Rover is an autonomous 6 wheel rover that uses a combnation of machine learning and affordable sensors to create a rover for outdoor and indoor exploration for a fourth of the price of a high end rover.

Echo Rover has been an ongoing project started in middle school for UCI's Rescue Robotics competition and has been the culmination of 5 years of work. After many diffrent iterations, some using basic android devices, to Googles Project Tango and now Nvidia's line of Jetson devices, this rover is all the sweet aspects of a good rover fit onto a simple base and mounted on simple affordable parts.
